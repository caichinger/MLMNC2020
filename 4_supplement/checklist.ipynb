    "  - Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan Adams).\n",
    "1. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often perform better than running them individually.\n",
